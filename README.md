##Pebble.rs

Pebble.rs is a crate that allows [rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) to be used to
develop Pebble applications. It is compatible with SDK 3.0 and is known to work
on the aplite platform. It *should* also work on basalt, but I don't currently
have one to test. 

To see an example application using Pebble.rs, look
[here](https://github.com/andars/pebble.rs-template).

*This is very much a work in progress and currently has very limited
capabilities.* **But it does work ;)**
